# Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP) for AI

## üß† Overview

MCP is a structured protocol that governs how AI agents communicate, coordinate, and share knowledge in a multi-agent environment. It‚Äôs essential in systems where agents must work collaboratively, competitively, or independently but with shared context.

---

## üîß Core Components of MCP

### 1. Message Format

Defines how data is serialized and deserialized between agents.

**Common formats**: JSON, Protobuf, MsgPack

**Typical message structure**:
```json
{
  "sender_id": "agent_1",
  "receiver_id": "agent_2",
  "timestamp": 1714822000,
  "message_type": "INTENT",
  "payload": {
    "goal": "collect_resource",
    "location": [10, 5]
  }
}
```

### 2. Communication Mode

- **Direct** (agent-to-agent)
- **Broadcast** (one-to-many)
- **Centralized** (via a controller or coordinator agent)
- **Pub/Sub** systems (e.g., via Redis, MQTT)

### 3. Synchronization

- **Synchronous**: Turn-based or frame-aligned updates
- **Asynchronous**: Real-time or on-demand communication

### 4. Protocol Semantics

- **INTENT**: Share planned goal
- **STATE**: Share current status
- **QUERY/RESPONSE**: Request and provide info
- **NEGOTIATION**: For cooperative settings

### 5. Routing and Discovery

- **Static routing**: Known peers
- **Dynamic discovery**: Register or multicast

## üîí Optional Features

### 1. Security

- Authentication and encryption (e.g., TLS)
- Prevent spoofing or MITM attacks

### 2. Fault Tolerance

- Retries, timeouts, heartbeat pings
- Fallback strategies

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Application

In a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment like StarCraft II:

- Agents might share strategies (‚ÄúI‚Äôm flanking from the left‚Äù), synchronize attacks, or dynamically divide control of units.
- MCP helps avoid redundant behavior, conflicts, and enables emergent coordination.

## üöÄ Benefits

- **Scalability**: Add/remove agents dynamically
- **Modularity**: Supports heterogeneous agents
- **Improved coordination**: Enables cooperation or competition
