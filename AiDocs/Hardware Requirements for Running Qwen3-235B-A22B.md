## Hardware Requirements for Running Qwen3-235B-A22B

- **GPU Requirements:**
Running Qwen3-235B-A22B efficiently requires extremely high-end hardware. For production-level performance, you need a multi-GPU setup-specifically, at least **four NVIDIA H100 GPUs**[^6]. Alternatively, configurations like five RTX 3090s (totaling 120GB VRAM), three L40s/A40s (144GB), or four Tesla V100 32GB cards (128GB) are also viable for local deployment[^5].
- **System RAM:**
If running on CPU (not recommended for performance), a workstation with **128GB–256GB of fast DDR5 RAM** is required, but inference speed will be much slower than on GPUs[^5].
- **Apple Silicon:**
A Mac Studio or Mac Pro with an M-series Ultra chip and **at least 128GB unified memory** can technically load the model, though cost and availability are significant factors[^5].
- **Quantization:**
Using 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) helps reduce VRAM demand, but even then, expect a minimum of **112GB–143GB** VRAM required for the model weights alone, plus extra for context processing[^5].

> In summary: Qwen3-235B-A22B is only practical on top-tier multi-GPU servers or specialized high-memory workstations. For most users, cloud deployment or using smaller Qwen3 models is recommended[^5][^6].
